# Codeforces Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to various [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) problems.  
I use **C++** for most problems, focusing on competitive programming techniques such as:

- Data Structures
- Dynamic Programming
- Strings and sorting
- Greedy & Brute Force

## 📂 Structure
- Each file corresponds to a single problem.
- Named by **contest number** and **problem letter** (e.g., `136A_A.cpp`).

## 🎯 Goal
Sharpen problem-solving skills and prepare for contests.
